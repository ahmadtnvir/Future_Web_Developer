              To build a strong foundation in web development, my current focus
              is on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These three
              technologies form the backbone of modern web development and are

              Having built a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, my
              next target is to delve deeper into more advanced technologies:
              ReactJS, Node.js, and MongoDB. These technologies will enable me
